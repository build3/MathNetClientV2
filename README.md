## Code style

Throughout the whole application we are complying to the [Airbnb code style](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript),
with following overrides:

- The indentation size is 4 spaces instead of 2.
- The line length *should* be kept under 80 characters. This rule may
  be broken if the readability of wrapped lines will be decreased: in
  such case the line *must not* exceed 100 characters. The comments
  should not exceed 72 characters.
